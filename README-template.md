## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS


### What I learned

This project was enjoyable and most of the CSS came to me intuitively by looking at the final design state and style-guide. There was some challenge in how to arrange the pricing section. Overall, I learned a lot about containers and CSS.


### Continued development

I'd like to grow my CSS skills.
